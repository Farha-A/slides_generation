Introduction
If you are taking IGCSE chemistry, using the Cambridge International 
Examinations syllabus 0620, then this book is for you. It covers the syllabus fully, and has been endorsed by the exam board. 
Finding your way around the book
The contents list on the next page shows how the book is organised.  Take a look. Note the extra material at the back of the book too: for example the questions from past exam papers, and the glossary. 
Finding your way around the chapters
Each chapter is divided into two-page units. Some colour coding is used within the units, to help you use them properly. Look at these notes:
Core curriculum
If you are following the Core curriculum, you can ignore any material with a red line beside it.
Extra material
Pages of this colour contain extra material for some topics.  We hope that you will find it interesting – but it is not needed for the exam.Extended curriculum
For this, you need all the material on the white pages, including the material marked with a red line.
Chapter checkups
There is a revision checklist  at the end of each chapter,  and also a set of exam-level questions about the chapter,  on a coloured background.
Making the most of the book and CD
We want you to understand chemistry, and do well in your exams.  This book, and the CD, can help you. So make the most of them!
Work through the units
 The two-page units will help you build up 
 
your knowledge and understanding of the chemistry on your syllabus. Use the glossary
 If you come across a chemical term that you do not 
understand, try the glossary
. You can also use the glossary to test yourself. 
Answer the questions
 It is a great way to get to grips with a topic. 
 
This book has lots of questions: at the end of each unit and each chapter, 
and questions from past exam papers at the end of the book.
Answers to the numerical questions are given at the back of the book. 
Your teacher can provide the answers for all the others.
Use the CD
 The CD has an interactive test for each chapter
, advice on 
revision, sample exam papers, and more. And finally, enjoy!
 Chemistry is an important and exciting subject. 
W
e hope this book will help you to enjoy it, and succeed in your course.

1.1
Made of particles
Rock, air, and water look very different. But they have one big thing in 
common: they are all made of very tiny pieces, far too small to see.  For the moment, we will call these pieces particles.
In fact everything around you is made of particles – and so are you!
Particles on the move
In rock and other solids, the particles are not free to move around. But in 
liquids and gases, they move freely. As they move they collide with each other, and bounce off in all directions. 
So the path of one particle, in a liquid or gas, could look like this:
 All made of particles!
from
heretohere
The particle moves in a random way, changing direction every time it hits 
another particle. We call this random motion.
Some evidence for particles
There is evidence all around you that things are made of particles, and that they move around in liquids and gases. Look at these examples.
Evidence outside the lab
1 Cooking smells can spread out into the street. This 
is because ‘smells’ are caused by gas particles mixing with, and moving through, the air
. They dissolve in 
moisture in the lining of your nose.2  Y ou often see dust and smoke dancing in the air, in 
bright sunlight. The dust and smoke are clusters of particles. They dance around because they are being bombarded by tiny particles in the air. State S of matter
6
Everything is made of particles

--- Page 8 ---
Diffusion
In all those examples, particles mix by colliding with each other and 
bouncing off in all directions. This mixing process is called diffusion. 
The overall result is the flow of particles from where they are more 
concentrated to where they are less concentrated, until they are evenly spread out.
So what are these particles?
The very smallest particles, that we cannot break down further by chemical means, are called atoms.
  In some substances, the particles are just single atoms. For example argon,
 a gas found in air, is made up of single argon atoms.
  In many substances, the particles consist of two or more atoms joined together
. These particles are called molecules. Water, bromine, and the 
gases nitrogen and oxygen in air, are made up of molecules.
  In other substances the particles consist of atoms or groups of atoms that carry a charge. These particles are called 
ions. Potassium 
manganate(VII) is made of ions.
You’ll find out more about all these particles in Chapters 2 and 3.
‘Seeing’ particles
We are now able to ‘see’ the particles in some solids, using very powerful microscopes. For example the image on the right shows palladium atoms sitting on carbon atoms. In this image, the atoms appear over 70 million times larger than they really are!
 This image was taken using a 
tunneling electr
on microscope.  
The white blobs are palladium atoms,  
the blue ones are carbon. (The colour was added to help us see them.)
Q
1 The particles in liquids and gases show random motion. 
What does that mean, and why does it occur?
2 Why does the purple colour spr ead when a crystal of 
potassium manganate(VII) is placed in water?3 Br omine vapour is heavier than air. Even so, it spreads 
upwards in the experiment above. Why?
4 a What is diffusion?   b  Use the idea of dif fusion to 
explain how the smell of perfume travels.

1 Place a crystal of potassium manganate(VII) in a 
beaker of water
. The colour spreads through the water. 
Why? First, particles leave the crystal – it dissolves. 
Then they mix among the water particles.2  Place an open gas jar of air upside down on an open  
gas jar containing a few drops of red-brown bromine. The colour spreads upwards because particles of bromine vapour mix among the particles of air.Evidence in the lab

Solids, liquids, and gases
What’s the difference?
It is easy to tell the difference between a solid, a liquid and a gas:
Water: solid, liquid and gas
Water can be a solid (ice), a liquid (water), and a gas (water vapour or 
steam). Its state can be changed by heating or cooling:
And when steam is cooled, the opposite changes take place:
You can see that:
  condensing is the opposite of evaporating
  freezing is the opposite of melting
  the freezing point of water is the same as the melting point of ice, 0  °C.A solid has a fixed shape and a fixed 
volume. It does not flow. Think of all the solid things around you: their shapes and volumes do not change.A liquid flows easily. It has a fixed volume, but its shape changes. It takes the shape of the container you pour it into.A gas does not have a fixed volume or shape. It spreads out to fill its container. It is much lighter than the same volume of solid or liquid.
1
 Ice
 slowly changes to water, 
when it is put in a warm place. This change is called melting. The thermometer shows 0
 °
C until 
all the ice has melted. So 0
 
°C is 
called its melting point.2
 When the water is heated its 
temperature rises, and some of it changes to 
water vapour. This 
change is called evaporation. The hotter the water gets, the more quickly it evaporates.3
 Soon bubbles appear in the 
water
. It is boiling. The water 
vapour shows up as steam. The thermometer stays at 100
 °
C 
while the water boils off. 100
 
°C is 
the boiling point of water.

9State S of matter
Other things can change state too
It’s not just water! Nearly all substances can exist as solid, liquid and gas. 
Even iron and diamond can melt and boil! Some melting and boiling points are given below. Look how different they are.
Showing changes of state on a graph
Look at this graph. It shows how the temperature changes as a block of ice is steadily heated. First the ice melts to water. Then the water gets warmer and warmer, and eventually turns to steam: 
A graph like this is called a heating curve. 
Look at the step where the ice is melting. Once melting starts, the 
temperature stays at 0
 
°C until all the ice has melted. When the water 
starts to boil, the temperature stays at 100
 
°C until all the water has turned 
to steam. So the melting and boiling points are clear and sharp.Substance Melting point  / °C Boiling point  / °C
